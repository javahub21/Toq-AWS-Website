    <h3>AWS Cloud Services</h3>
        <br>
        <p>AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of services including 
            computing power, storage, databases, networking. It enables organizations to access scalable and flexible IT resources on-demand, 
            eliminating the need for costly physical infrastructure. By using AWS, businesses can accelerate innovation, improve operational efficiency, and reduce costs by paying 
            only for the resources they use. Its global infrastructure and robust security features also help organizations maintain high availability and meet compliance requirements. 
            AWS provides a wide range of services, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS)</p>
        <p>Key areas of AWS Cloud Services, AWS Well-Architected Framework, AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF), EC2 Auto Scaling, S3, ELB, Virtual private cloud (VPC), RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora, Database Migration, 
            Redshift, API & REST, API Gateway, AWS Step Functions, Docker, CloudFront/Formation, Lambda, Route 53, CloudWatch/Trail, Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS Config, AWS Trusted Advisor</p>
    <h3>Python OOP</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="color:white;">Python is a high-level, readability and versatility programming language. In AWS (Amazon Web Services), Python is commonly used for automation, scripting infrastructure with 
            AWS SDKs like Boto3, creating serverless applications using AWS Lambda, and managing cloud resources via CloudFormation or CDK (Cloud Development Kit)
            In DevOps, Python is used to automate CI/CD pipelines, manage infrastructure as code (IaC), and integrate testing frameworks. With AWS, it supports tools like AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and Lambda, 
            enabling seamless automation of deployment, monitoring, and scaling tasks
        </p><br>
        <dl><dd> - Automation with Boto3: Python uses the Boto3 library to interact with AWS services programmatically. You can automate tasks like launching EC2 instances, managing S3 buckets, or configuring IAM roles without using the AWS Management Console.</dd></dl>
        <dl><dd> - Lambda Functions: Python is one of the primary languages supported for AWS Lambda, a serverless compute service. Developers write Python code to run backend logic, process events from S3, API Gateway, or DynamoDB, and moreâ€”all without managing servers.</dd></dl>
        <dl><dd> - Infrastructure as Code (IaC): While tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform are common for IaC, Python scripts can complement them by automating pre- or post-deployment configurations or custom resource provisioning.</dd></dl>
        <dl><dd> - Data Processing & Analytics: Python is used in services like AWS Glue for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs and in Amazon SageMaker for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.</dd></dl>
        <dl><dd> - Web App Development: Developers use Python web frameworks (like Flask or Django) to build applications that can be deployed on services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon ECS, or AWS Lambda with API Gateway.</dd></dl>
        <dl><dd> - Monitoring & Alerts: Python scripts can collect CloudWatch metrics, analyze logs, and send alerts or trigger actions when specific conditions are met</dd></dl>
        
        <p style="color:white;">Key DevOps tools used with Python:
            AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, Boto3, Docker & Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins/GitLab CI/GitHub Actions, Ansible, PyTest / UnitTest, 
            AWS Lambda (API Gateway build serverless API's), AWS CloudFormation, AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit),            
        </p>
    <h3>Linux</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In AWS (Amazon Web Services), Linux is widely used as the operating system for virtual servers (EC2 instances). It supports various Linux distributions, including Fedora, and is favored for its stability, performance, and cost-effectiveness. 
            Linux in AWS is commonly used for web hosting, application development, database management, and cloud-native computing tasks
        </p>
        <p> Key Linux CLI commands used with AWS, Configure AWS CLI credentials, Manage EC2 instances, S3 (Simple Storage Service) operations, IAM (Identity and Access Management),
            CloudWatch logs, Deploy using AWS CLI (e.g., for Lambda or ECS)</p>
        
        <h3>Networking</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="color: white;">Networking Cloud Concepts: VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), Subnets, Route Tables, Internet Gateway (IGW), NAT Gateway/Instance, Elastic IPs,
            PrivateLink, VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, AWS Direct Connect, Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">Networking Protocols: HTTP/HTTPS (TCP 80/443), TCP/UDP, DNS (Port 53), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), BGP (Border Gateway Protocol),
            SSH (Port 22), Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP Port 3389) Windows Instance, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), 
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;"> Security and Access: Security Groups, Network ACLs, AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF), AWS Shield and GuardDuty, IAM Roles/Policies, VPC Endpoints
        </p>
        <br>
    <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Cyber Security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage
        </p>
        <p>Cyber Security Skills/Tools Used with AWS: Identity & Access Management (IAM), Network Security (VPC, Security Groups, NACLs), Encryption (at rest & in transit)
            Compliance & Auditing (SOC 2, GDPR), Incident Response, Threat Detection & Monitoring, Security Automation (via Lambda, CloudFormation)
        </p>

        </p>
        <br>
    <h3>Database</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="color: white;">AWS offers managed database services for storing, querying, and managing data efficiently. SQL is best for structured, relational data, 
            while NoSQL fits dynamic, scalable workloads as both are fully supported with powerful AWS-managed services
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">SQL (Relational Databases): Amazon RDS Managed relational database (supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server),
            Amazon Aurora High-performance, cloud-native SQL database
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases): Amazon DynamoDB Key-value and document store, low-latency performance, Amazon DocumentDB Managed MongoDB-compatible service,
            Amazon Keyspaces Managed Apache Cassandra service, Amazon Neptune A fully managed graph database service optimized for storing and querying data
