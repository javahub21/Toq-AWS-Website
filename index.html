    <h1>Personal Bio</h1>
        
    <p>I am an enthusiastic and passionate AWS Cloud Engineer with proficiencies in Python, Networking, Linux, Database and Cyber security developed during my time on the Generation UK Bootcamp. I am driven to create cutting-edge scalable, 
        reliable and secure cloud environments while working efficiently within time frames. My training includes designing and implementing AWS cloud solutions that optimise performance and ensure data security. I thrive in 
        collaborative environments and value teamwork, deploying DevOps tools to provision Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automation to progressively achieve team milestones. My creativity and curiosity drives my success to work at the 
        forefront of technology innovation and create significant low-latency and high availability cloud projects. I offer embedded technical expertise across Tech, legal services sectors and a customer-centric approach gained from retail experience</p>
        
        <h3>Key Skills:</h3>
        <dl><dd>Collaborative Teamwork: worked in a team of four to develop a Book Caf√© App using Python and JSON, taking accountability in brainstorming, planning of system architecture (Lucidchart), and app development</dd></dl>
        <dl><dd>Problem Solving: I first identify the issue, deconstruct it into smaller, manageable tasks to thoroughly analyse the root cause before applying troubleshooting and monitoring tools to ensure fault tolerant systems</dd></dl>
        <dl><dd>Communication: as a Web Developer, I worked closely with clients to comprehend their needs, clarify design concepts and make sure the final product meets expectations. I am strongly confident in conveying technical processes to 
            non-technical teams, aligning team efforts across shared goals with precision and accuracy</dd></dl>
        <dl><dd>AWS and Linux: experience with scalable cloud services in EC2 auto scaling, S3 buckets, RDS, VPC and Lambda, allowing businesses to deploy infrastructure as code web applications that are reliable, secure and cost-effective.
